## Default Image

The image in this directory is the one currently used as our default.  

Place a copy of this image in the <code>thumb</code> 
sub-directory of your host's  directory for uploaded collection images (see <code>config.taggerImages</code>, in 
<code>routes.conf.js</code> for the directory location). The image will be served from there.
