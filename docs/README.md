***Public API Documentation***

This directory contains documentation for the Tagger public API. The documentation was created using swagger.io.
 
 The `tagger.json` file is a json version of the swagger.yaml file.  You can use it for quick browser viewing. 
 
 The `tagger.html` file is probably more useful. Use it by downloading the file to your local system and opening with a web browser.

The `swagger.yaml` file can be used with the Swagger Editor tool.  Download and install your own copy, or use the online version at:

    http://editor.swagger.io/#!/

If using the online version, select file > Import URL.  Then enter the URL for the swagger.yaml file in this repository:
